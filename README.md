# WeatherPulse-RT-Real-Time-Rollup-Aggregation-System:
Non-Functional Considerations:
While building the Real-Time Data Processing System for Weather Monitoring, I focused on a few key areas to ensure the app is robust and efficient:

1.Security: Managed API keys securely using environment variables to keep credentials safe. Added data validation to prevent security issues like injection attacks.

2.Performance: Optimized API calls with smart polling intervals and used in-memory caching to speed up response times. Batched data writes to reduce database load.

3.Scalability: Designed the system with Docker for easy deployment and scaling. The database schema is built to handle large amounts of weather data efficiently.

4.Error Handling: Built-in mechanisms to retry failed API calls and log important events. Configured alerts for critical conditions, ensuring timely responses to issues.

5.Maintainability: Kept the code modular for easy updates, with detailed comments and documentation. Included tests to ensure everything works as expected, even with future changes.
